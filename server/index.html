    <h1>PDF Generator</h1>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <p>
        Basically, get yourself a plugin or something that allows you to make post requests. I personally use Postman or
        curl. If you are seeing this, then you have already started the server with "npm start".
    </p>
    <p>
        With the server running, make a post request to the server to any of the post endpoints. Look in index.js for
        the "app.post" blocks to know the valid ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        To send data to the templates, look in the template you want to render and look for the replacement variables.
        Just add a JSON to the string to the request and add that variable to the json. For example:
    </p>

    <code>
        {
            foo: "My foo value"
        }
    </code>

    <p>
        This will replace {{ foo }} with "My foo value".
    </p>

    <h2>Example Call for Test</h2>

    <code>
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{ "title": "My PDF title" }' http://localhost:3000/test > ~/Test.pdf; open ~/Test.pdf
    </code>

    <p>
        Change the title by editing the above command and replacing "My PDF title" with anything you want.
    </p>
